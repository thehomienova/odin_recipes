    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chile rellenos are a traditional Mexican dish featuring roasted and
        peeled poblano peppers stuffed with cheese or meat, then dipped in 
        an egg batter and fried until golden. They are typically served with 
        a rich tomato sauce and can be accompanied by rice and beans.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large poblano peppers</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef or 
            shredded chicken (optional, can be made vegetarian)</li>
        <li> medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (like Monterey Jack or queso fresco)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>alt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the Poblanos: Preheat your broiler. Place the poblano 
            peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, 
            until the skins are blistered and blackened. Remove from the 
            oven and place the peppers in a plastic bag or cover with a 
            kitchen towel to steam for about 15 minutes. This will help loosen the skins.</li>
        <li>Peel the Poblanos: Once steamed, peel off the blackened skins. Be careful not 
            to tear the peppers. Cut a slit down one side of each pepper and remove the seeds 
            and membranes.</li>
        <li>Cook the Filling: In a large skillet, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add the 
            chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened. Add the ground beef or shredded 
            chicken (if using), and cook until browned. Stir in the cumin, chili powder, salt, 
            and pepper. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Mix in the shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Stuff the Peppers: Carefully stuff each peeled poblano with the filling mixture. Use 
            toothpicks to close the slit if necessary.</li>
        <li>Make the Batter: In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In another bowl,
            beat the egg yolks until thick and pale. Gently fold the egg yolks into the egg whites. 
            Spread the flour on a plate and season with a bit of salt.</li>
        <li>Coat and Fry the Chiles: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly dust 
            each stuffed chile with flour, then dip in the egg batter to coat. Carefully place the 
            coated chiles in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides. Remove and drain 
            on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped 
            onion and garlic, and cook until softened. Add the tomato sauce, cumin, chili powder, salt, 
            and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve: Pour some of the tomato sauce over the stuffed and fried chiles. Serve the 
            chiles rellenos hot, with additional sauce on the side if desired.</li>
    </ol>
