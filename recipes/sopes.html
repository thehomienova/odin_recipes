    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sopes are a traditional Mexican dish consisting of thick, 
        round masa cakes topped with a layer of refried beans, meat, 
        lettuce, cheese, and salsa. They are often garnished with 
        crema and avocado, providing a delicious blend of flavors and textures.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>masa harina</li>
        <li>beans</li>
        <li>meat</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>salsa</li>
        <li>crema</li>
        <li>radishes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Prepare the masa dough: In a large bowl, mix the masa harina with 
            the salt and gradually add water until a dough forms. The dough should 
            be soft but not sticky.</li>
        <li>2. Form the sopes: Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a 
            golf ball). Flatten each ball into a thick disk (about 1/4 inch thick).</li>
        <li>3. Cook the sopes: Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Cook the 
            disks on each side for about 1-2 minutes, until lightly browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>4. 	Shape the sopes: While the sopes are still warm, pinch the edges to 
            create a raised border. This will help hold the toppings.</li>
        <li>5. Fry the sopes: Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Fry the sopes until they are golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>6. Assemble the sopes: Spread a layer of refried beans on each sope, then add your choice of meat, lettuce, 
            cheese, crema, salsa, and other toppings.</li>
    </ol>
